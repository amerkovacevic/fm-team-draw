# Football Manager Team Draw

A lightweight Football Manager companion that helps friends spin up new saves by randomly
assigning clubs based on country or league preferences. Built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Assignment history

Recent draws are stored locally in the browser so you can revisit them anytime. Clearing
your browser storage will also remove the saved draws.

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite development server
- `npm run build` – create a production build
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint

## Styling

Tailwind CSS powers the UI with a custom palette inspired by stadium floodlights and pitch
textures, matching the dark, neon-accented aesthetic from the pickup soccer page.
